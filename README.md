# BigMartSalesPrediction
The project is about creating a predictive model to find out the sales of each product at a particular store.

1>Perfomed the data preprocessing tasks such as checking for null values and imputing the missing  values using  mice package.

2>Performed BiVariate and MultiVariate analysis and standardize the dataset required for model training.

3>Created ML models like Multiple Regression , KNN regressor, Random Forest Regressor , Neural Network on the training  dataset.

4>Accuracy metrics of above models on validation data are comapred amongst with each other and the model wilt the lowest RMSE is selected as the best model.
